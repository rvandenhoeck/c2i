				<h1>Stories as Networks</h1>
			</summary>

			<div class="details-content">
				<h3>Objectives</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>To build a multi-page website </li>
					<li>To experiment with navigation to convey meaning </li>
					<li>To interpret a story through expressive typography online </li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentinian writer famous for his short stories that deal with labyrinths, dreams,
					religion, and mathematical ideas (particularly set theory concepts like infinity and cardinality). His
					circuitous and meandering prose, full of allusions and vivid imagery, is a good way to think about the web as
					a network that has many nodes and many connections that continuously folds upon itself. It is the act of
					navigating through this maze that brings meaning to the web experience.</p>

				<h3>Project</h3>
				<p>Read the short story selections <a
						href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkCzT_zM8QrswoxG1wYQSN_-cPDruojhUOmO6_kVAnc/edit?usp=sharing"
						target="_blank">here</a>. Choose one short story and set the text using HTML and CSS (JS optional) so that
					the reader will not only be able to read the story but also experience your interpretation of the story. Use
					the visual language of the web—hypertext, responsive design, forms, color, divs—to express the meaning of your
					selected story.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You must use multiple views to convey this experience — it will be viewed on both large and small (mobile)
						screens. </li>
					<li>You may use no more than two typefaces</li>
					<li>Representational images are not allowed</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Considerations</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Point-of-View: What is text? What is writing? How do you see or read this particular text? The most
						successful projects have one point of view that is expressed through a decisive design move (some examples
						in the books below)</li>
					<li>Typography: How does the typography enhance your point of view and help you convey meaning? Pay attention
						to typographic details: special characters, leading, words per line, etc.</li>
					<li>Links: How do internal/external links enhance the meaning of this text? </li>
					<li>Scale of the Page: What happens to your site when the browser window is resized? Is it the same? Is it a
						different design? Are only certain information accessible at certain sizes?</li>
					<li>Do not try to illustrate the text. The least successful projects are ones that try to visualize the text
						literally. </li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Elastic Collection</h1>
			</summary>

			<h3>Due 4/02</h3>

			<h3>Objectives</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>To gather and organize a collection of data </li>
				<li>To understand metadata </li>
				<li>To tell a story through content curation and order</li>
				<li>To experiment with interactions with a collection</li>
				<li>To develop a working relationship of JavaScript objects and data collection</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Anything that you have an accumulation of can be a collection. An archive is a collection of historical
				documents or records. Not all collections are archives, but many become relevant with time. For our next project
				you’re tasked with creating a collection of 25 to 50 items. Any time you see a multiplicity of an object, you
				begin to notice similarities and contexts in a new way. Seeing multiple of an object allows for this kind of in
				depth research that observing one object does not. The way the object is documented (consider the various image
				making techniques we’ve explored this semester) and organized helps direct the viewer on how the object is meant
				to be experienced.</p>

			<h3>Project</h3>
			<p>Create a collection of 25 to 50 items. Your collection should have at least five different data types
				affiliated with it, and should be as specific as possible. There should be a visual consistency between the
				items, and should have a cohesive story to it. For example: If your collection is “Dogs in Central Park” you
				might include: photos of the dogs that you take on an iphone, the dog’s name, the dog’s breed, the GPS
				coordinates of where you saw the dog, and a brief description of the encounter. Once you collect your data, you
				will organize it into a local database and create a JSON file that houses all the relevant content. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Once you have your data collected and collection organized, you’ll design a webpage that houses the collection.
				Link the JSON file and pull the data in programmatically to display your content. Consider how the collection is
				organized and experienced — one at a time, in a grid, on separate pages? Consider if there are groupings within
				your collection and how the relationship between typography and mixed media can add a visual perspective to your
				work.</p>

			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A title for your collection</li>
				<li>You should pull your data in with a JSON file or using JavaScript objects</li>
				<li>Must be responsive and function on a mobile screen</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Does the type of content give form to your site?</li>
				<li>How can you tell a story through a curated set of text, visuals, interactive experiences?</li>
				<li>What kind of different data types can you use to add specificity and interest to your project?</li>
				<li>Does the arrangement of elements or the grid change? Does the site’s navigation change to highlight the most
					current content?</li>
				<li>Are there filters or subsections of your data?</li>
			</ul>

				<h1>NYC in Data</h1>
			</summary>

			<h3>Objectives</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>To reinterpret external sources of data into narrative experiences</li>
				<li>To develop an editorial perspective to content that is not your own</li>
				<li>To develop a working relationship with external content and code</li>
				<li>To connect and use structured content from an API (Application Programming Interface)</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Data is all around us and can help us understand new aspects about our environment. Using the New York City
				open data, you will select a dataset to work with. New York collects data ranging from parking violations to
				squirrel census. On its own, the data is a set of numbers that are difficult to comprehend without a
				visualization. Look through your chosen data and consider how you can tell a story through different subsets of
				it — you do not need to include all of it. Consider the relationship between the form, the story, and the data
				itself. How does the data’s container help encourage an understanding of the data not possible without it? Feel
				free to add in mixed media content to help tell this story, and avoid using traditional data visualizations such
				as bar graphs and pie charts.</p>

			<h3>Project</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Look through the New York City data on opendata.cityofnewyork.us and select one data to work with.</li>
				<li>Explore possible narrative components to the data based on how you filter it and categorize it. Will you
					work with the full set of data, or just a segment? How does the story of the data change based on the form?
				</li>
				<li>Design a website for this data set. Consider adding interaction and additional content.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Who is the audience? What mindset should the user be in when he/she uses the site? (Be specific)</li>
				<li>How does the user know what to do based on the design?</li>
				<li>Does the type of content give form to your site? </li>
				<li>How can you tell a story through a curated set of text, visuals, interactive experiences? </li>
				<li>Does the design of the site somehow respond to new content? </li>
				<li>Rather than being a neutral vessel, how can the design that you use to organize your collection change when
					the collection itself changes? For example, do colors on the site change in response to the kind or amount of
					content posted to the site? </li>
			</ul>
