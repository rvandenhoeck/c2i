		Imagining the practice of citation as a political act is a core ethos in Mindy Seu’s ambitious and
		hyper-comprehensive project, the Cyberfeminism Index. The website has been over a year in the making, and started
		out in the format of an open call and open-access spreadsheet, in an attempt to gather as many cyberfeminist
		projects, sources, and references as possible, together in one place. The term cyberfeminism is most often described
		as a contemporary genre of feminism, coined in the early 90’s to describe a wave of feminist critique, theorization,
		and a general reimagining of the internet and new media technologies. In the Cyberfeminism Index, Mindy Seu
		beautifully expands the definition of the term to encompass more than the relationship between women and technology:
		“Combining cyber and feminism was meant as an oxymoron or provocation, a critique of the cyberbabes and fembots that
		stocked the sci-fi landscapes of the 1980s. The term is self-reflexive: technology is not only the subject of
		cyberfeminism, but its means of transmission. </div>

	<div>It’s all about feedback.” “We are taught to focus on engineering, the
		military industrial complex, and the grandfathers who created the architecture and protocol. But the internet is not
		only a network of cables, servers, and computers. It is an environment that shapes and is shaped by its
		inhabitants,” Mindy states. Throughout the Index, a different story of the internet is told through the lens of its
		makers, and this multitude of definitions and voices echoes through the website, as all projects are described in
		their own words using original citations or pull quotes, emphasizing the multiplicity of cyberfeminism. Many
		original cyberfeminist websites from the 90’s are broken and hard to find, existing in the peripheries of the
		internet. This project acknowledges this disconnect between cyberfeminism’s iconic works and its legacy, which has
		had an enduring ripple effect on many areas of technological inquiry. Through the Index, the crucial vitality of
		cyberfeminism’s past is made visible, and it is (literally) linked with both the present and future.</div>
