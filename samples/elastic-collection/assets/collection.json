		"description": "Casa Luis Barragán, built in 1948 after the Second World War, was Barragán’s residency and studio located in Miguel Hidalgo district, Mexico City. With the exception of the breakfast nook, the house is designed to not need artificial light during the day, with windows and other openings placed to let in as much light as possible. Opposed to functionalism, Barragán claimed that \"any work of architecture which does not express serenity is a mistake.\"",

The house was built with the intention to view and observe the surrounding landscape. The house’s exterior walls are made from glass, and despite the lack of walls inside the house, there is a sense of rooms due to the precise placement of furniture. Most of the furniture in the house was designed in 1930 by Johnson’s friend and mentor, Mies van der Rohe.",
