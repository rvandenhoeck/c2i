			<ul>
				<li class="t-b-1">Share your Github Page URL</li>
				<li class="t-b-1">Questionnaire
					<ol class="t-l-1 code">
						<li>Describe your previous experiences with coding. What classes have you already taken where you were exposed
							to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? What parts were most confusing?</li>
						<li>How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in
							this class to help reduce this anxiety?</li>
						<li>How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</li>
						<li>What text editor do you prefer to use?</li>
						<li>Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub.</li>
						<li>Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this
							relationship. Bonus points for creative analogies.</li>
						<li>Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there are six levels
							of heading tags, `h1` through `h6`).</li>
						<li>Create an unordered list ( `ul` ) and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related
							websites. Include a paragraph ( `p` ) on each site describing why it is important to you.</li>
						<li>Insert an image (`img`) that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes `alt text` that
							describes the image.</li>
						<li>Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
							You have a few ways you can approach this:
							<ul>
								<li>Look into the `iframe` tag. Hint: If using a YouTube or Vimeo video, you can copy the embed code from
									each video’s page.</li>
								<li>Use a `video` tag, though finding the URL of a video can sometimes be tricky – do you best to download,
									place it in your project folder, then reference its file path</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to
							maintain proper indentation.
							<ul>
								<li>`main` → `section` → `div` → `p` → `span`</li>
								<li>No need to fill these tags with any actual content</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another
							ordered list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure
							you nest your ordered lists properly.</li>
						<li>Use `pre` tags to create a simple [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry) version
							of a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.
							<ul>
								<li>Hint: `pre` tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will show
									up like that when you view the web page.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Write an HTML comment that is hidden from the browser, but displays in the code.</li>
						<li>Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item
							that matches the genre of music of that artist.</li>
						<li>Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.</li>
						<li>Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 15. Give each genre a color and personality
							using CSS.</li>
						<li>Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update
							the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).</li>
						<li>In a `script` tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). Tell me
							something interesting about yourself.</li>
						<li>Add a `button` to your HTML file and make it do something when clicked using JavaScript</li>
					</ol>

			<h3>📚 Assignments</h3>
			
			<p class="t-b-1">Reverse-Engineer HTML Structure and CSS</p><br>

			<p class="t-b-2">The best way to learn how something is made is by taking it apart. So, in this week’s assignment, we are going to go out there in the wild fields of the Internet and see what we can glean from analysing a webpage’s source. We won’t be going without tools, though, since we have Chrome’s Developer Tools ( Command+Option+I ) help us with examining the HTML structure and and experiment with CSS.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Your assignment is to:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Find one webpage out there in the wild, whose HTML/CSS structure is reasonably legible. </li>
				<li>Inspect the page via Chrome Developer Tools( Command+Option+I ).</li>
				<li>Under a new folder/directory (e.g. '/html-analysis') of your local Github repository</li>
				<li>Within your name folder/directory, create a new html file (e.g. index.html)</li>
				<li>Paste <a href="https://github.com/rvandenhoeck/c2i/blob/main/samples/reverse-engineering.html">this template</a> into your new HTML folder. It will save you setup time and guide you through the directions.</li>
				<li>Follow the guide! There are 3 distinct sections:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Screenshot: Provide a visual reference to site of interest and a preview of what the source code looks like (via Dev Tools).
						</li>
						<li>
							Analysis: This comes in two parts. On the left, provide a simplified view of what the HTML structure looks like within the <code>pre</code> tag. On the right, try to explain the different parts of the structure. Some thought-starters:
							<br>
								
							<ol>
								<li>Why does this element have that class applied to it? What could it be used for? Does the class have semantic meaning (e.g. `article-grid`)?</li>
								<li> What is each “container” doing? Is it providing extra structure? Is it a stand-alone container for some interactive element? It is a part of the navigation? Is it part of the main content, or does it feel secondary?</li>
								<li>What are the components of the site? If it's a news site, what element represents an article? If its a fashion e-commerce site, what element represents a shop-able item? How are these structured?</li>
								<li>Poke around in Dev Tools! What happens if this class is not applied to the element (double-click the target’s class attribute in the Element Pane and remove the class)? What if I toggled off an element whose position is “fixed”?</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							Questions:
							<br>
							Well, you can’t understand everything! Take note of things you may have been curious about, but couldn’t grasp. For example, "As I was scrolling the page, I noticed that the inline styles of <code>compass-wrapper</code> were changing rapidly…what is that about?", or "I’m not familiar with this CSS selector…"
						</li>
						<li>
							Bonus: Simplified Prototype
							<br>
							If you are feeling ambitious, then in this section, you can try to recreate the structure, but with dummy content.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Once done, publish your changes to Github!</li>
